# CARMA Roadmap

*[Updated 28 Feb 2019]*

This page presents the current vision for future release activity of the CARMA platform.  It is focused on version 3 (CARMA3) since that is a major upgrade.
Beyond that the future is less clear, although we will definitely be pushing the system toward SAE level 4 autonomy while continuing to extend the sophistication of the V2x communication capabilities and resultant cooperative behavior.

Since this system is being developed in an agile environment, no precise schedule of future functionality exists.  However, the below figure presents a notional picture of what the development team expects at this time.  It is subject to change with each sprint.  Each of the relevant epics tracked in our Jira backlog is represented in a separate row, grouped and color coded by relationship.

Our first major goals are:
- **Take receipt of first level 2 vehicles, April 2019** - The Saxton Lab will receive two passenger vehicles from [AutonomouStuff](https://autonomoustuff.com) running native [Autoware](https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware).  Efforts are already underway to modify the CARMA software to integrate with Autoware so that we get the best of both systems.
- **Beta release of CARMA3, June 2019** - This will be the first release of CARMA integrating Autoware and providing the basics of SAE level 2 automation on these new vehicles, along with some of the legacy cooperative capabilities already present in CARMA2.
- **Installation on heavy trucks, October 2019** - The CARMA system will be installed on four class 8 tractor-trailer trucks owned by FHWA and FMCSA.  Instrumentation of these trucks is currently underway at [AutonomouStuff](https://autonomoustuff.com).
