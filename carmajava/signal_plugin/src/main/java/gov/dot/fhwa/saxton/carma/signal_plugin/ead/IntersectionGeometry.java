	//Every lane has a stop bar, defined by its node 0.  If the vehicle is associated with that lane, then it has a laneDtsb_, which is the
	//distance from the vehicle along the segments of that lane to its stop bar.  On approach to the intersections this is simply the DTSB
	//for the whole scenario.  It gets tricky when we pass that stop bar and proceed through the intersections (through the stop box) and
	//on to the egress lane, however.  Once we cross that approach lane stop bar the DTSB for the scenario needs to be negative, and continue
	//to grow to more negative values as the vehicle proceeds farther downtrack from that approach stop bar.  Eventually, the vehicle will
	//associate with an egress lane.  Its distance to that stop bar will at first be small (positive), then grow as we drive farther away from
	//the stop box.  Just using this new lane's DTSB clearly is not what we want for the scenario's DTSB, which needs to become larger negative.
	//Therefore, at the point of transition between the approach lane and the egress lane (probably somewhere in the stop box), we store the
	//lastApproachDtsb_ and the firstEgressDtsb_ to allow proper math in the computation of the scenario's overall DTSB from that point on.
